        /*
        Problem 25: Immutable Class Example

        Description:
        Design a simple immutable class (e.g., ImmutablePoint) with final fields, no setters, and only getters and constructors. Demonstrate that values cannot be changed after creation.

        Sample Input:
        Create point (2,3)

        Sample Output:
        Point: (2,3)
No way to modify x or y after creation.
