        Problem 15: Pass-by-Value Demonstration

        Description:
        Demonstrate Java's pass-by-value behavior by writing a method that tries to swap two integers and show that original variables in main are unchanged.

        Sample Input:
        a = 5, b = 10

        Sample Output:
        Before swap: a=5, b=10
Inside method: a=10, b=5
After method: a=5, b=10
