Problem 46: Adapter Pattern for Logging APIs

Description:
You have an existing Logger interface but need to integrate with a third-party logging library that has a different API. Use Adapter pattern to bridge them. Create adapter classes in their own package.

Sample Input:
Call oldLogger.logInfo('Hello')

Sample Output:
Underlying third-party logger receives appropriate call.
