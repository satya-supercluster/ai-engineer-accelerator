Problem 44: Singleton Pattern for Configuration Manager

Description:
Implement a thread-safe Singleton for a ConfigurationManager that loads properties once and provides getters. Show different singleton implementations (eager, lazy with double-checked locking) in separate classes.

Sample Input:
Access config from multiple parts of code

Sample Output:
ConfigurationManager instance reused everywhere.
