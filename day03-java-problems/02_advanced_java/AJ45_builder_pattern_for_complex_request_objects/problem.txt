Problem 45: Builder Pattern for Complex Request Objects

Description:
Use the Builder pattern to construct a complex HttpRequest object with many optional fields (headers, query params, body). Organize builder and main class in separate files.

Sample Input:
Build GET request with header X-Request-Id and query param page=1

Sample Output:
HttpRequest{method=GET, url='...', headers=..., queryParams=...}
