Problem 48: DTO and Mapper Pattern for API Layer

Description:
Create domain entities and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and implement a mapper class to convert between them. Organize entities, DTOs, and mappers in separate folders. Focus on immutability and null-safety.

Sample Input:
UserEntity{id=1, name='Alice'}

Sample Output:
UserDto{id=1, fullName='Alice'}
